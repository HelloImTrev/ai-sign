# Ai-Sign

**Application deployed at: https://ai-sign.herokuapp.com/**

This application is a solo project that was built in a 24 hour hackathon. The idea was to create an app that would help the user learn ASL 
(more specifically the alphabet) with the help of AI and their webcam. Ai-Sign relied on a tensorflow model for hand tracking and pose identifcation,
while the canvas API took the position of the anchor points and created the wire mesh.
